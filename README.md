Absolutely! Here's a well-structured and beginner-friendly `README.md` for your **Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collector** project in C. This assumes you're building an educational or experimental memory management system that demonstrates garbage collection using frames and objects like strings, integers, and vectors.

## 📦 Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collector in C

A simple memory management system implementing a **mark-and-sweep garbage collector** from scratch in C. This project models a virtual machine (VM) with stack frames, dynamic object allocation, and automatic memory cleanup.

---

### 🧠 Overview

This project simulates memory management typically found in high-level languages like Python or JavaScript. It allows you to:

* Allocate and reference heap objects (strings, integers, vectors)
* Use frames to manage object visibility
* Run garbage collection to automatically free unused memory

---

### 🗃️ Features

* ✅ Custom VM and frame system
* ✅ Supports Strings, Integers, Vector3 (triple of objects)
* ✅ Reference tracking via stack frames
* ✅ Manual and automatic mark-and-sweep GC
* ✅ Simple unit testing without third-party libraries

├── vm.c / .h               # VM and garbage collection logic
├── test_gc.c               # Manual test cases
├── Makefile (optional)
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

### 🧪 How to Run Tests

You can run the included test cases (without external frameworks):

#### Compile:

```bash
gcc -o test_gc test_gc.c vm.c snekobject.c sneknew.c -I. -Wall
```

#### Run:

```bash
./test_gc
```

You should see output indicating that each test has passed and object counts during GC.

### 🛠 Example Test Output

```text
==== Running test_simple ====
[init] VM created. Object count: 0
[alloc] String object allocated and referenced in f1.
[gc] Garbage collected. Object count: 1
[frame] Frame f1 popped and freed.
[gc] Garbage collected. Object count: 0
==== test_simple passed ====
...
✅ All tests passed successfully.
```

### 🧹 What is Mark-and-Sweep GC?

Mark-and-sweep garbage collection works in two phases:

1. **Mark**: Traverse all reachable objects from active frames and mark them.
2. **Sweep**: Free all unmarked objects, i.e., objects no longer in use.

This approach helps avoid memory leaks in long-running programs.

---

### 🤓 Concepts Demonstrated

* Manual memory allocation in C
* Graph-based reference modeling
* Garbage collection algorithms
* Frame-based scope tracking
* Debugging memory via test harness

---

### 📚 Future Enhancements (Ideas)

* Add support for cyclic reference detection
* Implement generational GC
* Visualize heap and reference graph
* Add logging or tracing for GC internals
